# NanaZip-Dark-Mode
Forked from Huan 7Zip Dark Mode

I attempted to use the 7Zip Dark Mode created by Huan (https://github.com/huanrenfeng/7zipDarkmode), made minor modifications using Resource Hacker to change both the app icon and toolbar icon, and also to hide the menubar since it couldn't apply the dark mode. Afterward, I replaced the NanaZip.exe file within the NanaZip msixbundle.

The end result was that I achieved a 7Zip dark mode appearance, complete with the NanaZip icon and capability to display the menu in the Windows 11 Context Menu.
